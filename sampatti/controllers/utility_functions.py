Input Text: {user_input}
employer_number: {employer_number}
existing record: {context} 
next_month: {next_month}
next_month_year: {next_month_year}

Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the entire user input.
2. Extract all relevant financial and attendance details.
3. Always compare with the existing record and accordingly give the value.
4. currentCashAdvance is the cash advance we will make changes in this field according to the user wants.
5. If any information is missing, use existing record expect Repayment_Start_Month and Repayment_Start_Year to {next_month} and {next_month_year} correspondingly.
6. If user give cash advance and repayment amount and does not mention the repaymnet start moth then set Repayment_Start_Month to {next_month} and Repayment_Start_Year to {next_month_year}.
7. Be flexible in understanding variations of input.
8. Always include all fields in the result for all cases.
9. don't include current cash cash unless it is mentioned by the user.
10. Analyze the key word properly make changes according to the user wants if user wantes to changes the salary then make changes in the salary field according to the user wants.


Extraction and Update Rules:
- Focus on extracting or modifying specific fields mentioned in the input.
- Always analyze the entire input to ensure all relevant fields are considered.
- If there is not any mention of cash advance then make current cash advance it as 0.
- If your wants to change the salary then make changes in salary field according to the user wants.
- If only one field is discussed, keep other fields from existing record and give them updated information in final output.
- If input suggests adding/changing amount, then add or change according to the existing record field.
- If no specific amount given, use existing record's value.
- Validate and adjust values logically don't give random value.
- use existing record and update the existing record according to the user wants and only change the field which user wants rest keep as it existing record.
- for deduction field only make change if user wants to make change in the salary else keep it as 0.
- deduction is only the amount that is deducted from the salary amount as per {user_input}.
- If user give cash advance and repayment amount and does not mention the repaymnet start moth then set Repayment_Start_Month to {next_month} and Repayment_Start_Year to {next_month_year}.

Specific Field Extraction:
- currentCashAdvance: 
  * Look for cash advance, advance, loan, cash award or financial support amounts.
  * Make change only if there is mention any cash advance, advance, loan, or financial support amounts.
  * don't take any unnecessary values into if unless cash advance or related term mentioned in the {user_input}
  * take the value for the currentCashAdvance from the existing record if no cash advance is mentioned in the {user_input}

- Monthly Repayment: 
  * Find planned monthly repayment amount.
  * It is the amount give corresponding to the cash advance.
  * If nothing related to repayment is specified in the {user_input} take the repayment amount from the existing record.
  
- Bonus: 
  * Identify any bonus or additional payment.
  * If bonus is mentioned in the {user_input} then return the value from the user input.
  * If nothing related to bonus is specified in the {user_input} take the bonus 0.
      

- Attendance: 
  * If attendance is mentioned in the {user_input} then return the value from the user input.
  * If nothing related to attendance is specified in the {user_input} take the Attendance value from the existing record.
  * If it is mentioned that the worker was on leave for let's say 7 days then take the attendance as {attendance_period} - 7.
  * If user says worker was present for full month or present for all days or was not on leave or attendance is 100 percent or anything similar to this statemet then make attendance as {attendance_period}.
  * it should not be 0 anytime.


- For Repayment_Start_Month:
  * If user mentions a specific month (e.g., "March", "June"):
    - Set the value of Repayment_Start_Month to the value which user mentions and then return in the response.
  * If user says next month then set the Repayment_Start_Month as {next_month}.
  * If user does not mention the month in the {user_input} then take the Repayment_Start_Month as {next_month}.

- For Repayment_Start_Year:
  * If the user mentions a specific year like (2025, 2026, "january 2025", "march 2026"):
    - Set the value of Repayment_Start_Year to the value which the user mentions and then return in the response.
  * If user does not mentions anything related to the year then set the value of Repayment_Start_Year as {next_month_year}.
  * If user does not mention the year in the {user_input} then take the Repayment_Start_Year as {next_month_year}. 
   
- For detailsFlag:
  * If the {user_input} is containing information which says mean that the details which are provided are correct then just make the detailsFlag to be 1 otherwise let it 0.
  * for e.g., If {user_input} says "yes" or it says "yes, correct details" or it says "all details are correct" or it says "yes, all the provided details are correct." or similar stuff then make the detailsFlag to be 1 otherwise let it be 0 only. 
  
- For nameOfWorker:
  * If user mentions a name then take it from the {user_input} but if not then take it from the existing record.
  * for e.g. If user says that, please pay a cash advance of 20000 with a monthly repayment of 5000 to utkarsh sharma then extract the nameOfWorker as "utkarsh sharma".
  * for e.g. If user says that, pay om a advance amount of 40000 to with a monthly repayment of 10000 then take nameOfWorker as "om".
  * for e.g. If user says that, i want to give vrashali a bonus of 70000 and attendance of 25 then take the nameOfWorker as "vrashali".
  * for e.g If user says that, Please change the salary of utkarsh to 12000 rupees, then take the nameOfWorker as "utkarsh".

- For salary:
  * If user mentions the salary then take the salary amount from the {user_input} and if not mentioned then take the salary amount from the existing record.
  * It should never be 0.
  * check if user has world similar to word salary or monthly payment or simailar.
  
- For Deduction:
  * If user mentions the word deduction then take the value from the {user_input} and keep it in deduction field.
  * The deduction is the amount that is deducted or changed from the salary amount.

- If no specific value mentioned, preserve existing record's value.

- Ensure final values are reasonable and consistent
- For partial updates, only modify mentioned fields
- Always include all fields in the result for all cases.
- don't make change in the Cash_Advance unless it is necessary change in the currentCashAdvance.

Return ONLY a valid JSON focusing on fields mentioned or changed:

        3. If the answer does not match the current question, check if it matches other questions. If it matches other questions, extract the answer and question ID and repeat the question with the question ID only once with respect to {worker_id}.
        4. if the  and answer is yes, then for  save the response accordingly and give it in the extracted answers.
        5. If the user answers "Yes" to a yes/no question, add a corresponding inferred answer to related follow-up questions (e.g., if question 6 is "Yes," save question 8 as "You have a bank account").
        6. If the user answers "No," add a corresponding inferred answer to related follow-up questions (e.g., if question 6 is "No," save question 8 as "You do not have a bank account").
        7. Extract the user's answer and match it to the corresponding question ID.
        8. Generate the next most relevant question based on the provided answer.
        9. Ensure that the response is structured correctly and includes the extracted answers and the next suggested question. 
        10. Generate the next most relevant question based on the provided answer.
