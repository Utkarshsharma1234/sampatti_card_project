    template = """You are an intelligent assistant helping to extract precise financial and attendance information for an employee cash advance record.

Input Text: {user_input}
employer_number: {employer_number}
existing record: {context} 

Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the entire user input.
2. Extract all relevant financial and attendance details.
3. Always compare with the existing record and accordingly give the value.
4. currentCashAdvance is the cash advance we will make changes in this field according to the user wants.
5. If any information is missing, use existing record.
6. Be flexible in understanding variations of input.
7. Always include all fields in the result for all cases.
8. if month is extracted from user input then year also should be extracted don't make it 0.
9. extracted month and year should be always grater than {current_date}.


Extraction and Update Rules:
- Focus on extracting or modifying specific fields mentioned in the input.
- If only one field is discussed, keep other fields from existing record and give them updated information in final output.
- If input suggests adding/changing amount, then add or change according to the existing record field.
- If no specific amount given, use existing record's value.
- Validate and adjust values logically don't give random value.
- use existing record and update the existing record according to the user wants and only change the field which user wants rest keep as it existing record.

Specific Field Extraction:
- currentCashAdvance: 
  * Look for cash advance, advance, loan, or financial support amounts
  * Make change only if there is mention any cash advance, advance, loan, or financial support amounts.
  * don't take any unnecessary values into if unless cash advance or related term mentioned in the {user_input}
  * take the value for the currentCashAdvance from the existing record if no cash advance is mentioned in the {user_input}

- Monthly Repayment: Find planned monthly repayment amount
- Bonus: Identify any bonus or additional payment
  * Take the bonus amount from the existing record and then if the user asks to change the bonus amount then change it or if he wants to add more amount into bonus do the necessary steps from the {user_input}.

- Attendance: 
  * If attendance is mentioned in the {user_input} then return the value from the user input.
  * If not specified use the value from the existing record.
  * If it is mentioned that the worker was on leave for let's say 7 days then take the attendance as {attendance_period} - 7.
  * If user says worker was present for full month or present for all days or was not on leave or present 100 percent or anything similar to this statemet then make attendance as {attendance_period}.
  * it should not be 0 anytime.


- For Repayment_Start_Month:
  * If user mentions a specific month (e.g., "March", "June"):
    - Set the value of Repayment_Start_Month to the value which user mentions and then return in the response.
  * If user does not mention the month then use take from existing record and if user does not have existing record then make Repayment_Start_Month='sampatti'.
  * If user does not mention the month in the {user_input} then take the Repayment_Start_Month from the existing record and return.
  

- For Repayment_Start_Year:
  * If the user mentions a specific year like (2025, 2026, "january 2025", "march 2026"):
    - Set the value of Repayment_Start_Year to the value which the user mentionsand then return in the response.
  * If user does not mentions anythiing related to the year then set the value of Repayment_Start_Year to 0. 
  * If user says start repayment from the month(e.g., "March", "June") and if month is above the {current_month} then set the to the month and Repayment_Start_Year to the {current_year}+1.
  * If user says start repayment from the month(e.g., "March", "June") and if month is below the {current_month} then set the to the month and Repayment_Start_Year to the {current_year}.
  * e.g if month extracted from user input is may and current month is october and current year is x then make Repayment_Start_Year as x+1.
  * e.g if month extracted from user input is may and current month is february and current year is x then make Repayment_Start_Year as x.
   
- For detailsFlag:
  * If the {user_input} is containing information which says mean that the details which are provided are correct then just make the detailsFlag to be 1 otherwise let it 0.
  * for e.g., If {user_input} says "yes" or it says "yes, correct details" or it says "all details are correct" or it says "yes, all the provided details are correct." or similar stuff then make the detailsFlag to be 1 otherwise let it be 0 only. 
  
- For nameOfWorker:
  * If user mentions a name then take it from the {user_input} but if not then take it from the existing record.
  * for e.g. If user says that, please pay a cash advance of 20000 with a monthly repayment of 5000 to utkarsh sharma then extract the nameOfWorker as "utkarsh sharma".
  * for e.g. If user says that, pay om a advance amount of 40000 to with a monthly repayment of 10000 then take nameOfWorker as "om".
  * for e.g. If user says that, i want to give vrashali a bonus of 70000 and attendance of 25 then take the nameOfWorker as "vrashali".
  * for e.g If user says that, Please change the salary of utkarsh to 12000 rupees, then take the nameOfWorker as "utkarsh".

- For salary:
  * If user mentions the salary then take the salary amount from the {user_input} and if not mentioned then take the salary amount from the existing record.
  * If user says add or subtract some amount from the salary then do the necessary steps and return the salary amount.
  * It should never be 0.

Key Processing Instructions:
- Use integers for monetary and attendance values.
- If no specific value mentioned, preserve existing record's value.

- Ensure final values are reasonable and consistent
- For partial updates, only modify mentioned fields
- Always include all fields in the result for all cases.
- don't make change in the Cash_Advance unless it is necessary change in the currentCashAdvance.

Return ONLY a valid JSON focusing on fields mentioned or changed:
